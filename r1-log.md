## Log

### R1D1 - 6/14/18
Restarted #100DaysofCode because I missed some days.
* Figured out how to make Docker create the front-end
* Figured out how to get Docker to serve the Vue.js front-end on the host
* Got frontend (Vue.js) and backend (Python 3.6 and Flask) working and talking to each other
