## Log

### R1D1 - 6/6/18

Started working on Docker file and automation of prompts in vue-cli using expect for replication.
* Docker file created installing all necessary software needed at this stage
* Created .exp script to automate vue-cli prompts. 

Things are not quite working how I would like for them to. I want on build to run the "expect" file and it
populate the host directory. Maybe I can get around this with the ENTRYPOINT within the Dockerfile on container run.

### R1D2 - 6/7/18

Researched how to make the expect file to work and did testing on based on research. It was unsuccessful.

### R1D3 - 6/8/18
